My Excel Portfolio project

Task1	"Use vlookup to bring the following columns from sheet2 to sheet1:
1) fuel
2) registration city
3) assembly
4) transmission
5) condition"
   
Task2	"Create a new column called selection that will show SELECTED for the cars that meet ALL the following conditions:
1) Fuel is either Petrol or CNG
2) City is not Karachi
3) Make could be any except Toyota and Honda

Column should show NOT SELECTED  for all the rest
You will need to combine AND(), OR() and NOT() for the condition for IF()"


Task3	"Extract Model from the Make Model column into a separate column
(for example extract Mehran VXR from Suzuki Mehran VXR)

hint: you can do this in different ways. You can use text to column and then CONCAT().
Look into how you can also do this in one go using the FIND(), RIGHT() and LEN() functions "


Task4	"make a miles_per_year column 
(change kms to miles and then divide by the number of years that have passed between car year and current year 2024)
Round it off to 3 decimal places 

"
